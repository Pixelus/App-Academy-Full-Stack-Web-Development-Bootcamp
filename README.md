## App Academy Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp

This folder is created to store my work files for [App Academy Open](https://open.appacademy.io/). I'm currently working on the bootcamp with the goal to become a software developer and these files reflect my progress through my exercices, coding challenges and my projects.
The repository will be frequently updated with my solutions to all the exercises and challenges from the curriculum.

### What is App Academy Open

[App Academy Open](https://open.appacademy.io/) is a full-stack web development bootcamp to becoming a software engineer. It covers ~1500 hours of material including fundamentals such as data structures and algorithms, design patterns, scalability, OOP, TDD, computational complexity, and software engineering best practices. Programming languages and technologies include Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React-Redux, SQL, Git, HTML and CSS.

### App Academy Prep Work & Independent Study

 * **[Introduction to Ruby](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/become-a-web-developer/)** on LeetCode 
 * Book **[The Well-Grounded Rubyist](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1617295213/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A1X6FK5RDHNB96&psc=1)**, Third Edition, a perfect tutorial for newcomers to Ruby and a great way for experienced Rubyists to deepen their understanding of the language.
 * Cheat Sheet **[Ruby Essentials](https://cheatography.com/pixelus/cheat-sheets/ruby-essentials/pdf/)**, memo that I made during learning Ruby
