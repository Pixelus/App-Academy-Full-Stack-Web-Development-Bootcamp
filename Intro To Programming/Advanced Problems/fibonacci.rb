# The fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers whose first and second elements are 1. To generate further elements of the sequence we take the sum of the previous two elements. For example the first 6 fibonacci numbers are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. Write a method fibonacci that takes in a number length and returns the fibonacci sequence up to the given length.

def fibonacci(length)
  sequence = [1, 1]
  if length == 0
    sequence = []
  elsif length == 1
    sequence = [1]
  else
    while sequence.length < length
      sequence << sequence[-1] + sequence[-2]
    end
  end
  return sequence
end
