## App Academy Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp

This folder is created to store my work files for [App Academy Open](https://open.appacademy.io/). I'm currently working on the bootcamp with the goal to become a software developer and these files reflect my progress through my exercices, coding challenges and my projects.
The repositorie will be FREQUENTLY updated with my solutions to all the exercises and challenges from the curriculum.
