## App Academy Bootcamp

This folder is created to store my work files for [App Academy](http://www.appacademy.io/). I'm currently working on the bootcamp with the goal to become a software developer and these files reflect my progress through my homework and my projects.

### What is App Academy

[App Academy](http://www.appacademy.io/) is a full-stack web development bootcamp to becoming a software engineer. It focuses on Ruby on Rails, JavaScript,  React, Redux, MERN stack, Docker and GraphQL with over 1,500 hours of material (readings, videos, projects).
